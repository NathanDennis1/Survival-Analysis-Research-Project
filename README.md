# COVID-19 Survival Analysis Research-Project
Undergrad research done through UW for credits in the Statistics Deparment's Directed Reading Program.

Research-Project.Rmd has some of the R code used to create the results. No specific analysis done there, but in write up.

COVID Pres.pdf contains the slides for my presentation, then the write up (which I did not 100% follow) is under COVID Presentation Outline.
